The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. \u2013 See more at: http:\/\/consumercal.org\/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa\/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<\/p>\n<p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<\/strong><br \/>\nUsers can visit our site anonymously.<br \/>\nOnce this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.<br \/>\nOur Privacy Policy link includes the word \u2018Privacy\u2019 and can easily be found on the page specified above.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 On our Privacy Policy Page<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can change your personal information:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 By emailing us<br \/>\n\u2022 By calling us<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking<\/p>\n<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States\u2019 consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children\u2019s privacy and safety online.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?<br \/>\n<\/strong>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.<strong><br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Fair Information Practices<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Within 7 business days<\/p>\n<p><strong>We will notify the users via in-site notification<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Within 7 business days<\/p>\n<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and\/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act<\/strong><br \/>\nThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Send information, respond to inquiries, and\/or other requests or questions<br \/>\n\u2022 Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.<br \/>\n\u2022 Send you additional information related to your product and\/or service<br \/>\n\u2022 Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.<\/p>\n<p><strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.<br \/>\n\u2022 Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.<br \/>\n\u2022 Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.<br \/>\n\u2022 Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.<br \/>\n\u2022 Honor opt-out\/unsubscribe requests quickly.<br \/>\n\u2022 Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at<\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Contacting Us<br \/>\n<\/strong>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using the information below.<\/p>\n<p>sotaimaging.com<br \/>\n1073 N.
